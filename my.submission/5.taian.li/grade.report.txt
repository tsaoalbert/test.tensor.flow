Discussion:
      I learned how hard and complex the algorithm is in the class and assignment. There are a lot of new ideas on the algorithm like the sorting method since I learned them a long time ago. I need to google them and take more practice to overcome the problems on how to calculate the big O as well.

  3.12 (-10%) Extend the program from Listing 2.15 to handle palindromes with spaces. For example, 
          I PREFER PI is a palindrome that reads the same forward and backward if you ignore the blank characters.
  Answer: use the following statement to remove spaces and case-sensitivity from the input string s.
        s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalpha())
        s = s.upper()

    Q#12: (-10%) (Repeat the above question for the doubly linked lists.) What is the time complexity of 
        the doubly linked list remove method when the item to be removed is in the last node. 
        Explain the reason. Would the time complexity if the item to be removed is not the last node?

  Answers: O(1)
        whether the item to be removed is the last node or not, the remove method of the doubly circular 
        linked list will only take O(1) time


I do not really understand what Rule E, first remove any operators already on the opstack that have higher or equal precedence and append them to the output list, means?  In the example given in the question, it seems to push the operator into the opstack only, instead of removing or append them to the output.
