Week 3:  Average:  23/100



Hw3, Grade: 0/100

* 3.1 (10/10%) Modify the infix-to-postfix algorithm so that it can handle errors.

* 3.12 (10/10%) Extend the program from Listing 2.15 to handle palindromes with spaces. For example, I PREFER PI is a palindrome that reads the same forward and backward if you ignore the blank characters.



(30%) Modify the unorderedList class as follows: 
* 0/6 allow duplicates
* 0/6 remove method can work correctly on non-existing items
* 0/6 Improve the time of length method to O(1)
* 6/6 Implement __str__ method so that unorderedList are displayed the Python way
* 6/6 Implement the remaining operations defined in the UnorderedList ADT (append, index, pop, insert).


(3/10%) Use doubly linked lists to implement queue, stack, and deque that would have have an average performance of O(1)  for operations of adding or removing operations. Hints: implement deque first, then you can build stack and queue on top of deque
