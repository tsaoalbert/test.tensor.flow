Look at this link: http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html
I find this link to be very useful in helping us structure our B.Sc Data structures class. 

For the M.Sc use most of the structures and you can supplement with more "difficult" examples. 
The main thing is to use Python.
The Jupyter Notebook we are using is from Anaconda . You can download it from the web.
